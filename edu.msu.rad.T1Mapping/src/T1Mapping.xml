             Filename:  ComputeT1NoiseThreshold.m
             Created:  July 2011
             Description:  Performs an analysis of the histogram of an image
             volume and determines a threshold value to exclude the first peak of
             the histogram, which arises primarily from low-valued noise voxels in
             the air outside of the subject.
             Usage:
             [threshold, volume] = ComputeT1NoiseThreshold(inputSlab, descentFromPeak)
             Computes a threshold value to separate low-valued noise voxels 
             from voxels with signal present that should be included in 
             subsequent processing.  A copy of the 3D matrix (volume) that is
             produced from the inputSlab is also returned for convenience in
             further processing to produce the desired 3D mask to filter the
             computed T1 maps.  inputSlab is in the format specified in
             ClearCanvasToT1MatlabBridge.cs (located in the
             ClearCanvas.MSU.SeriesSelector project).  descentFromPeak is a
             parameter that should be between zero and one that determines the
             fraction of the difference in height between the first peak of the
             histogram and the first valley, starting from the peak, at which
             the threshold should be set.  This value is adjusted to ensure that
             the threshold values adequately remove noise voxels without being 
             overly agressive and filtering out valid signal.

             Usage:
             [intervalNumber, successFlag] = ContainingInverval(index,
             intervalList)
             Finds the index in the intervals described by the intervalList if the
             index is within any of the intervals defined by intervalList and, if
             so, returns an intervalNumber such that intervalList(intervalNumber)

             Usage:
